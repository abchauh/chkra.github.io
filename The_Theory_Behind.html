<h4>The theory behind what we do...</h4>

<p><strong>Campaigns &amp; Projects</strong></p>

<p><em>Let the sensible thoughts flourish...</em>Whether its a petition or a simple conscious thought, the idea behind campaigns is to create and spread awareness for different causes, raise voice and stand for change in a situation.</p>

<p><em>There are millions making a difference in someway...let's help them. </em> With Projects, we provide a platform to users to help in a cause with a coordinated effort, It could be a volunteering event or an idea which could bring a difference.</p>

<p><em>With Campaigns and Projects, we provide power to users to promote goodwill and cause of those who are working at the ground level. Backed with Non-Profits, organizations, social enterprises and above all people who believe in making a difference. 
We plant the seeds of change with different projects and campaigns and with a co-ordinated and collective effort</em></p>


<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>

<p><em>The concept is to fund-raise a part money on every purchase from our shop for a campaign or project on Chkra to help someone at ground level with the help of accredited organizations/ Non-profits.</em></p>

<p>The idea is to create a self -sustainable cycle which could exist and flourish at the same time. That’s why it’s called Chkra.</p>

<p><strong>Blogs, Promote & Content control</strong></p>

<p>Spread your cause and reach out to your audience with a personalized blog post page.</p>

<p>Promote what you feel is right, something which makes a difference, something which is worthwhile knowing and talking about etc.</em></p>
<p>Mark or Flag things, users and content which are inappropriate; ideas, thoughts which are unnecessary, diabolical etc</p>
<p><em>The idea behind “Promote” is to surround ourselves with people, things and thoughts which matter and should be propagated. Thoughts &amp; views are contradictory by nature - So what and who distinguish between right and wrong, between correct &amp; incorrect. 
We leave it to the users to decide - what’s should be promoted in Chkra and what’s not.</em></p>

<p>Content control is one of the biggest challenge to keep this network away from becoming a useless user amass.
So we created a set of real time algorithms and entropic indexes to evaluate the behaviour and activities on Chkra. 
The purpose is to ensure that inappropriate content and users are removed/ blocked.</p>

<p><em>The intention is to “Keep it clean” and give a complete control to users to decide what stays on Chkra and what’s not. 
As we proceed, with experience and feedback we will continue to improve these algorithms.</em></p>

<p><strong>The theory behind everything</strong></p>
<p><em>Clicking is easy, standing up is tough; it gets easier when you have others with you, those who believe in same as you. And before you know, it gets stronger</em>
<p><strong>"Chkra"</strong> is all about creating a network of such accountable individuals, with collective effort, goodwill and good sense of belief; we create a cycle and season of change. 
An ecosystem which could not just sustain and evolve but make a differnce at the same time.</p>
<p>And We want to be represnted as an attempt made by people to make world a better and saner place not a corporate building an empire.<p>

<p><strong><em>That is why it's called Chkra.</em></p>
