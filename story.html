<h4>For those who wonder</h4>

<p><em>For those who wonder why?</em></p>

<p>It all started with a thought and an intention to bring a difference, so we decided to create a brand which could inspire &amp; spread social change, a brand which represents the righteous in the world. So we started Peacers,with an intent to spread out the things which we know are right  but we often forget.</p>

<p>But how we turn this into a phenomenon, so widespread and impactful - that it could possibly bring a change at a bigger level rather than just fundraising for charity? How we connect and involve with the people? We turned our heads around ? and we came up with ?Chkra? ? a social network where people connect to make the world a better place, where we promote what is worthwhile propagating in the world.</p>

<p>A self sustainable network, where people hold the power to drive things, where we value change and a better world around us.</p>

<p><em>For those who wonder how we help?</em></p>

<p>We work with a <strong>"Buy some give some"</strong> business model:</p>

<p>On every purchase on this platform, we fund-raise a part of sale to help someone at the grass-root level. We currently assist in sponsoring children with help of accredited NGOs our cause will evolve as me move forward. Thus, rather than working with a traditional corporate social responsibility model we try to create shared value for the community and ourselves.</p>

<p><em>For those who wonder how will we sustain and grow?</em></p>

<p>We rely on our retail shop &amp; marketplace business model to sustain and flourish initially and expect other opportunities to open up as we move ahead. There are few ideas in our head already, we are not playing blind...</p>

<p><em>And if you wonder - do we really need this?</em></p>

<p>Yes, we do. We live in a world where negative sells In this world disillusioned by negatives and people trying to harm our peace - there has to be an attempt made by people to make our world a saner place. We are - "not a corporate building an empire" but people building a better world with good sense and belief. And you know what, it's priceless to see the world changing around and being a part of it - that's all we want.</p>
